# Unity2019114f1-2D-Template

### Project description: 
This Project contains a headline, a button, and four empty objects, which each one of them is in a corner. By pressing the button the Ball moves to one of these corners, but never moving to the same corner in a row. 

### Development platform: 
* MacOS Catalina 10.15
* Unity 2019.1.14f1
* Visual Studio Code 1.41.1

### Target platform: 
WebGL RefRes 960x600

### Visuals: 

<div>   
    <img src = "./Screenshots/Screenshot_Unity.png" width="500">
    <img src = "./Screenshots/Screenshot_Script.png" width = "500">
</div>

### Necessary setup/execution steps: 
ToDo

### Third party material: 
GitHub Temp. : 3ahmnm-htlsbg/Unity2019114f1-2D-Template

### Project state: 
WebGl is not build and needs therefore to be build. GUI is build and Script is working. Percent: ~75%

### Limitations: 
Game is not finished, since we didn't learn how to create game with WebGl

### Lessons Learned: 
* Generating random Numbers
* Using Sprite and assign Picture to it
* Using Arrays in Scripts
